## Executive Summary 
In this lesson, I am hoping to learn about authentication and how it works to protect users. I also want to learn about ACL and RBAC and the advantages and disadvantages of both. I have no information on encryption so it will be very interesting to see how encryption works out. I also want to learn about layers and application layers and see how they interact with applications. I also want to learn about internet browser security and learn how to secure my browser. Lastly I am excited to pratice more with HTML and see how it compares to XML. 

## Cybersecurity and Encryption

### Information Systems Security

#### Security Triad
Confidentiality- It would require amazon to keep chat logs unavailable to the public.
integrity- Have appropriate security measures in place to ensure that anyone that shouldn't be able to access it can not. Also have fail safe in place so that a change can not be made to the data accidentally.
availability- ensure that users are able to promptly(immediately) access their data after providing correct log-in information. Also have their servers available 24/7. 
#### Authentication
1. Log in into your phone. - Can be multi factor authentication by requiring a pin and your finger print. 
2. Log into email.- Can be multi factor authentication by entering your password and accepting a prompt on your phone. 
3. Log into replit.- Can be multi factor authentication by entering your password and opening an email. 
#### ACL and RBAC
ACL- Acl says which user can access an object and which actions the users can do. 
RBAC- RBAC assigns permissions based on roles in an organization.
Advantages of using ACL- Better suited for implenting security for individuals for low level data. disadvantage- harder to impliment organization wide.
Advantages of using RBAC- RBAC can apply permisons based on roles. Can give organizations wide permissions easily. Another advantage is that with an administrator it is easier to manage company security. 
disadvantage of using RBAC- RBAC can not provide access to a specific file to a specific person. 
#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key
A public key creates the Ciphertext, the ciphertext is sent to the recipient. Once recieved the private key decrypts the ciphertext. 
#### Public Key Cryptography
Public Key Encryption is important because it makes it infeasibile to determine the encryption key. It uses a math formula that makes it easy to send the public key, but near impossible to reverse the formula and find out the key compnents.This makes it really hard for hackers to find out private information.

### Cryptography
#### Encryption
Fbehu vhfxulwb lb ixq- This is "Cybersecurity is fun" shifted to the right 4. 
#### Frequency Fingerprint
Generally speaking, there is a pattern to the letters we use in the english language. For example, the letter E is the most used letter. 
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher
A Polyalphabetic Cipher is a cipher that uses multiple ceasar shifts based on a shift word. 
#### Polyalphabetic Example
vmcpw isdfwbhz tx yio- This is "Cybersecurity is fun". I used the shiftword SNAKE.
#### Brute-Force
Brute-Force is using all possible decryptions for a cypher. This is feasible for ceasar cypher, but for more complex cyphers, it becomes less and less feasible. 

## Internet Architecture
### Internet Protocol
#### IP Address
IP Address is a unique identifier for each comptuer. The difference between IPV4 and IPV6 is IPV4 uses a 32 bit IP address, where as IPV6 uses 128 bit IP address. 
#### ICANN
ICANN aids with the handing out of IP adress to ensure that there are not duplicates IP address amongst other things. This contributes to the global internet by organizing IP addresses making sure no errors are made and no duplicates are made. 
### TCP/IP
#### Responsibility of TCP/IP
TCP/IP is making sure the correct data gets sent to the correct location. TCP collects and reassembles the packets of data. Ip is responsible for making sure the packets are sent to the right direction.

#### Client-Server Model and TCP/IP
In the case of the client server model, the client is the device that is sending packets of data.  The server is the computer attempting to recieve data.
#### Layers
Layers are important because specific task can be changed without affecting the other layers. Without layers, the whole Application would have to be changed to change one task. But with layers, it makes changing technology easier. Each layer has a specific function associated with it.
#### Application Layer
The type of applications that run on the application layer are applications that handle the users data. 

## Internet Security
#### HTTP and Client-Server Model
HTTP is a Protocol that allows the fetching of resources. It supports the client server protocol because the requests are iniated by the recipient. The client and servers communicate using requests and responses. 
#### Protocols for Secure HTTP
HTTPS encrypts the data being sent using encryption algorithms to scrammble the data.

## Securing your Web Browser
#### Reasons to Secure Browser
There is increasing threat from software attacks that take advantage of vulnerable web browsers. They can get vital information and steal your private information. (passwords, billing addresses, house address) Some examples include: Many users tend to click on links without considering the risk of the link. Web page addresses can be disgused to take you to an unexpected site. Many users do not know how to configure their web browsers securely. 
#### Risk Explained
"Third party software may not have mechanism for receiving security updates." One vital thing about computer security is staying up to date with vulnerabilites of your comptuer. If you aren't getting constant security updates you can fall prey to newer cyber attacks that the computer security is not updated for. 
## Internet Programming
#### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is cofunder inrupt.com and is the director of the W3C. He created the W3C to make a world wide standard for the web. Also it helps reach the full potential of the web. One standard is Accesability. This is important because people with disabilites need to be able to access the website. This will make the web page have a greater reach of audience, and will direct more traffic to the website, due to the web page being more accessabile to people. The standards for Accessability are: Alternative text for images, being accessabile without a mouse, transcripts for audio.
#### HTML5 and CSS
HTML5 and CSS are used to create web pages and style them how you want them. We used an external CSS file to format the webpage. Using an external file allows for the same formating to be used across different pages. This saves time and energy when creating web pages. 
#### HTML and XML
XML mainly focuses on the transfer of data while HTML focuses on the presentation of data. XML is content driven while HTML is format driven. XML is strict for closing tags, while HTML is not. 
## Components of a URL
Scheme-HTTPS
Domain- www.amazon.com
top level domain- .edu
default page- no file path provided 
Parameters- Result of your search 
anchor- Specific location on a page
## File compression
File compression reduces the total file size as well as reducing the time it takes to transfer the file.
The difference in size between the SVG file and JPG file is because SVG is a link to a webpage that contains the image, the JPG is the actual image, and not a link. 
## Conclusion
 I have learned a lot this lab! I have learned about file compression, how it can save time from transfering the file and reduce the size of the file. I learned the components of a url, learned how HTML and XML differ. I got more pratice in with HTMLS and CSS. It was really interesting to learn how a Polyalphabetic cypher works. I also got a better understanding of ciphertext, public key, and private key. I also learned the security triad.
